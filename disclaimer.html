    <p class="subtitle">Legal Disclaimer & Terms of Use</p>
    <p class="last-updated">Last updated: February 2025</p>

    <div class="callout red">
      <strong>Important Notice:</strong> pumprocket.io is a real-money prediction game built on the Solana blockchain. By accessing or using this platform you agree to be bound by this disclaimer in full. If you do not agree, you must immediately cease use of the platform. Participation carries significant financial risk — only play with funds you can afford to lose entirely.
    </div>

    <!-- 1 -->
    <h2 id="acceptance">1. Acceptance of Terms</h2>
    <p>
      By accessing, browsing, or using pumprocket.io (the "Platform"), you confirm that you have read,
      understood, and agree to be legally bound by this Legal Disclaimer and all applicable laws and
      regulations. This agreement is effective from the first moment you access the Platform.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you are using the Platform on behalf of an organisation, you represent that you have the
      authority to bind that organisation to these terms. In that case, "you" and "your" refer to
      that organisation.
    </p>

    <!-- 2 -->
    <h2 id="no-financial-advice">2. No Financial Advice</h2>
    <p>
      Nothing on pumprocket.io constitutes financial, investment, legal, tax, or any other form of
      professional advice. The Platform, its interface, results, multipliers, and any associated
      communications are provided strictly for entertainment purposes.
    </p>
    <p>
      You should not interpret any game outcome or feature of the Platform as a signal, forecast,
      or recommendation regarding any financial instrument, digital asset, or investment strategy.
      We strongly recommend consulting a qualified, licensed professional before making any financial
      decisions involving digital assets.
    </p>

    <!-- 3 -->
    <h2 id="risk-warning">3. Risk Warning</h2>
    <p>
      Participating in pumprocket.io involves wagering SOL (Solana), a highly volatile cryptocurrency
      whose value may fluctuate significantly and without warning. You may lose the entire amount
      wagered in any given session, and there is no guarantee of recovering any losses.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>All bets are final once confirmed on-chain and are <strong>irreversible</strong>.</li>
      <li>The Platform has an inherent house edge — over time, expected return is less than the amount wagered.</li>
      <li>Past results do not predict future outcomes. Every round is statistically independent.</li>
      <li>The crash point is determined randomly and cannot be predicted, manipulated, or influenced by any player.</li>
      <li>The monetary value of SOL winnings may decrease between winning and conversion to fiat currency.</li>
      <li>Playing under financial pressure, emotional distress, or intoxication significantly increases risk of loss.</li>
    </ul>

    <!-- 4 -->
    <h2 id="eligibility">4. Eligibility</h2>
    <p>By using the Platform you represent and warrant that:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>You are at least <strong>18 years of age</strong>, or the legal age of majority and gambling age in your jurisdiction, whichever is higher.</li>
      <li>Online gambling, crypto wagering, or prediction games with real assets are <strong>not prohibited</strong> in your country, state, or jurisdiction.</li>
      <li>You are accessing the Platform <strong>voluntarily</strong> and on your own behalf, not on behalf of any third party.</li>
      <li>You are not a person who has been <strong>excluded or self-excluded</strong> from gambling platforms.</li>
      <li>You have not been declared <strong>legally incapacitated</strong> or incapable of entering binding agreements.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      It is your sole and exclusive responsibility to determine whether your use of the Platform is
      lawful in your jurisdiction. pumprocket.io makes no representation that access is legal in all
      locations, and accessing the Platform from a prohibited jurisdiction is done entirely at your own risk.
    </p>

    <!-- 5 -->
    <h2 id="restricted-territories">5. Restricted Territories</h2>
    <p>
      The Platform is not available to residents or citizens of the following jurisdictions, and
      persons located in these territories are prohibited from accessing or using the Platform:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>United States of America and its territories</li>
      <li>United Kingdom</li>
      <li>France and its overseas territories</li>
      <li>Netherlands and its territories (Aruba, Curaçao, Sint Maarten)</li>
      <li>Australia</li>
      <li>Any jurisdiction subject to comprehensive sanctions by OFAC, the EU, or the UN</li>
      <li>Any other jurisdiction where online gambling or crypto wagering is explicitly prohibited by law</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      pumprocket.io reserves the right to restrict access from any additional territory at any time
      without notice. Use of VPNs or other tools to circumvent geographic restrictions is a material
      breach of these terms and may result in permanent suspension and forfeiture of funds.
    </p>

    <!-- 6 -->
    <h2 id="no-guarantee">6. No Guarantee of Service</h2>
    <p>
      The Platform is provided on an <strong>"as is"</strong> and <strong>"as available"</strong> basis
      without any warranties of any kind, whether express or implied, including but not limited to
      implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, or non-infringement.
    </p>
    <p>
      We do not warrant that:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>The Platform will be available uninterrupted, error-free, or free of viruses or harmful components.</li>
      <li>Defects or errors will be corrected.</li>
      <li>Results obtained from the Platform will be accurate or reliable.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      The Platform may be suspended, modified, or permanently discontinued at any time without prior
      notice. We are not liable for any losses — financial or otherwise — arising from downtime,
      maintenance, bugs, network congestion, or any other service interruption.
    </p>

    <!-- 7 -->
    <h2 id="blockchain-risks">7. Blockchain & Smart Contract Risks</h2>
    <p>
      pumprocket.io operates on the Solana blockchain. By using this Platform you explicitly
      acknowledge and accept the following risks:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Irreversibility:</strong> All blockchain transactions are permanent. Once confirmed, they cannot be cancelled, reversed, or retrieved under any circumstances.</li>
      <li><strong>Network volatility:</strong> Solana network congestion, forks, outages, or protocol changes may delay, fail, or invalidate transactions.</li>
      <li><strong>Smart contract risk:</strong> Despite security efforts, smart contracts may contain undiscovered bugs, logic errors, or vulnerabilities that could result in partial or total loss of funds.</li>
      <li><strong>Wallet security:</strong> You are solely responsible for the security, custody, and backup of your wallet and private keys. pumprocket.io will <strong>never</strong> request your private key, seed phrase, or password.</li>
      <li><strong>Transaction fees:</strong> All on-chain interactions require Solana network fees (gas) paid in SOL. These fees are non-refundable regardless of outcome.</li>
      <li><strong>Regulatory risk:</strong> Changes in applicable law or regulation may affect the legality, functionality, or availability of blockchain-based services at any time.</li>
      <li><strong>Third-party wallets:</strong> pumprocket.io is not responsible for issues arising from third-party wallet software (e.g. Phantom), browser extensions, or infrastructure providers.</li>
    </ul>

    <!-- 8 -->
    <h2 id="intellectual-property">8. Intellectual Property</h2>
    <p>
      All content on the Platform — including but not limited to the name "pumprocket.io", logos,
      graphics, user interface design, source code, game logic, and written content — is the
      exclusive intellectual property of pumprocket.io and its operators, protected by applicable
      copyright, trademark, and intellectual property laws.
    </p>
    <p>
      You may not copy, reproduce, distribute, modify, create derivative works from, publicly display,
      or exploit any part of the Platform without express prior written consent from pumprocket.io.
    </p>

    <!-- 9 -->
    <h2 id="privacy">9. Privacy & Data</h2>
    <p>
      pumprocket.io does not require account registration. Wallet addresses used to interact with
      the Platform are public information recorded on the Solana blockchain and are not considered
      personally identifiable information under this disclaimer.
    </p>
    <p>
      Optional profile data (username, avatar) provided by users is stored solely to enhance the
      user experience and is not sold or shared with third parties. By providing any such data you
      consent to its storage and use for these purposes.
    </p>
    <p>
      All on-chain transaction data is permanently and publicly recorded on the Solana blockchain.
      pumprocket.io has no ability to delete or modify on-chain records.
    </p>

    <!-- 10 -->
    <h2 id="responsible-gaming">10. Responsible Gaming</h2>
    <p>
      pumprocket.io is committed to promoting responsible gaming. Gambling can be addictive.
      If gaming is negatively affecting your finances, relationships, or mental health, please
      seek help immediately.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Set a strict budget before playing and never exceed it.</li>
      <li>Never chase losses — statistically, chasing does not improve outcomes.</li>
      <li>Take regular breaks. Set time limits for each session.</li>
      <li>Do not play while intoxicated, emotionally distressed, or under financial pressure.</li>
      <li>Do not borrow money to fund gambling activity.</li>

    <p>
      You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless pumprocket.io, its operators, affiliates,

      damages of any kind arising from or related to your use of or inability to use the Platform,

      In jurisdictions that do not allow the exclusion of certain warranties or limitation of
      liability, our liability is limited to the maximum extent permitted by law. In no event
      shall our total cumulative liability exceed the amount of fees (if any) paid by you to
      pumprocket.io in the thirty (30) days preceding the claim.
    </p>
    <p>
      Your sole and exclusive remedy for any dissatisfaction with the Platform or these terms

      accordance with applicable international law, without regard to conflict of law provisions.
    </p>
    <p>
      Any dispute arising out of or in connection with this disclaimer that cannot be resolved

      If any provision of this disclaimer is found to be invalid, illegal, or unenforceable under
      applicable law, that provision shall be modified to the minimum extent necessary to make it
      enforceable, or severed if modification is not possible. The remaining provisions shall
      continue in full force and effect.
    </p>
